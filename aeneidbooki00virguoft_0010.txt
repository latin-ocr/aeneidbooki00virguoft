Vergil began his studies at Cremona, where, we aro told,
he assumed the noya viril-‘⁸ on the same day on which

Lucretius died. The town itsclf had already been noted,

having been the birthplace of Furius Bibaculus, and of the
critic, Quinctilius Varro.

After a brief stay at Cremona, and subsequently at Medio-
lanum (Milan), the poet went to Rome. · In the capital,
Vergil, after the fashion of the day, attended the lecturos
of rhetoricians and philosophers. Under Epidius, the rhe-
torician, the teacher οἱ Marc Antony and afterwards of
Octavius, and under the Epicurean philosopher, Siron, the
poet became acquainted with the outlines of rhetoric and
philosophy. Itis quite probable that his father intended him
for the bar, but a weak voice and a diffident manner were in-
superable barriers in the way of obtaining distinction in
public speaking. Vergil soon gave up rhetoric, and, in fact,
renounced poetry for the more congenial study of philosophy.
Under Siron, he seems to have made considerable progress in
Epicurean philosophy. and the love he retained for this branch
of learning is plainly observable in many of his extant
writings.‘ In a minor poem, generally supposed to be genuine,
he welconies the exchauge of poetry and rhetoric for more
useful studies:

“Away with you, empty coloured flagons of the rhetori-
cians, words swollen, but not with the dews of Greece 3 md,
away with you, Stilo, 'ragitius and Varro, you, nation oi
pedants, soaking with fat: you, empty cymbala of the class-
room. Farewcll, too, sabinus, friend of all my friends ; now,
sarewclL all iny beautiful companions, we are setting our
sails for a haren of bliss, going to hear the learned words oi
the great Siron, and we mean to redet-m our life from 211
distraction. Farcwcll, too, swcct Musam for, to tell the
nuth, 1 have found how swcct you were: and yet, 1 puy
you look on my pages again, but with modesty and at rare
intervalnsffl

After a short stay at Rome, Vergil probably went to anlee,
where, we are told, Parthenius, another Epicurean, was his
instructor. 'l'hc great Epir-⁰ os Lucretius, added to tho
