the apt and charming episodes, all combine to lend an
interest to a subject, which in any other hands would have
been intolerably dull. The time was ripe for such a poem.
Agriculture had been the chief employuient and the honored
ocoupation of the Romans from the early days of the
oisy. The long-continued wars had, however, desolated
Italy,²¹ and Vergil with sorrow laments, “the plough bath
not its meed of honor, the fields lie neglected, and the
tillers are off to the war; the crooked pruning hooks are
forged into stiff smrdsss’w Even after war had ceased, the
soldier, too long amustomed to camps and the excitement of a
military life, cared little about the prosaic life of a farmer.
To recall the peaceful habits of rural industry, the poem,
which Addison pronounces “the most complete, elaborate
and finished piece of all antiquity,” was written. The Ῑῖνκι σωιεεῃεεο]
book treats of tissage, the second of orchards, the third of the (lew-‘7¹⁶⁸'
care of horses and cattle, and t'ne som-ela of bees. The two
most successful imitatione in English of this poem are Philips’s
Ραειοναῑε, and Thompson’s Seasons. Yet, no one can read
the English imitations without being struck with their in-
feriority to the poem of Vergil.
The Aeneid‚2³ in twelve books, written between 29 B.C. Ameid.
and 19 B. C„ recounts the story of the escape of Aeneas from
burning Troy, his wanderings over the deep in search of a
home which the futes had promised, his final settlement in
Italy as the founder of the Roman Empire destined iu after
ages to rule the world. No doubt, Vergil, borrowed largely
frum the Greek and Roman writers who preceded him. The Vergn'l .
