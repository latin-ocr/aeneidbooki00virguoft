teaehings of his instructors gave, no doubt, his mind a strong
bent towards the doctrines of Epicurus. It is probable that
the poet returned to his father’ s farm before the outbreak of Re ,u um
the war between Pompey and Cacsar, B. U. 49. Itis also likely home.
that he remained there till after the battle of Philippi (B. O.

42), aud that he employed his time in gaining by observation

materials which he afterwards employed in his great didactic

poem, the Georgies. Unlike Horace, Vergil sympatlrized

with the party of Caesar. The formation of the Second
Triumvirate threw the Roman world into the broils of a civil

war. In the division of the provinces, the Gauls (except

Gallia Narbonensis) fell to Antony. 'l‘he lands of eighteen

cities were given up to reward the legions of the unscrupu-

lous Antony, and among the lands were those of Cremona.

The district around this city failing to satisfy the greedy

rapacity of the legionaries of the T riumvir, the farms of the
neighbouring Mantua were seizeL and among the lands eon-

fiscated were those of the poet's father, C. Asinius Pollio, slffflfffs ΜΒ
the prefect of (r 'allia Tra11111a‹lc111z,unable to restrain the
lawlessness of the soldiers of Antony, sent Vergil to Rome

with a recommendation to Augustus to allow the poet to

retain his paterna] estate. It is quite probable that con-

genial tastes aud a recognition of the genius of Vergil may saga: uhu
have influenced Pollio to take this course. At the close of

the same year (41 B.C.), however, war broke out anew
between Octavius and L. Antonius. Pollio, was deposed from
office, and Alfenus Varus appointed iu his stead. Another
division of lands follow ed, and the poet is ‘said to have been
deprived of his estate the second time. ⁷ His friends Gallus, ᾖ ’ἱξῇᾝη „⁴
Pollio, and Farus, how ev er, intcrposed and saved his farm. sarm-
By them he was introduced to Maecenas, the patron of
litei-ary men—afterwards the prime minister of Augustus.

This year marks the beginning of the rising fortunes of the Β 0.- '0-
poet. With his friend and patron, Pollio, as Consul, VergilsL'r runt '¹35⁸ ,s
became the honoured member of a literary coterie which ¹‘⁷57⁸‘-
graced the table of Maecenas. The intimacy that Vergil

enjoyed at court, is shewn by his being one of those who

went to Brundisium along with Maecenas, when the latter

was negotiating a treaty between Augustus and Antony.⁸
