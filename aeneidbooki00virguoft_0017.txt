Crutwell thus defends Vergil in regarcl to the main charge: ¹²¹¹

“The Aeneid was meant to be, above all things, a nationald‘ff

poem, carrying on the lines of thought, the style of speech,
which national progress had chosen ; and it was not meant to
eelipse, so much as to do honor to, carly literature. Thus
those bards who, like Ennius and Naevius, had done good
service to Rome by singing, however rudcly, her history, find
their imayines ranged in the gallery of the Aeneid. Thus

they meet with the flamens and pontiffs, who drew up the
ritual formularies; with the antiquariaus and picus scholars,

who had sought to find a meaning in the immemorial nameS,
whether of place or custom or person ; with the magistrates
novelists and philosophers, who had sti-iven to ennoble and
enlighten Roman virtue, with the Greek singers and sages,
for they, too, had helped to rear the towering fabric of Roman
greatness. All these meet together in the Aeneid, as in
solemn conclave, to review their joint work, to aeknowledge
its final completion, and to predict its impending downfall.
This is beyond question the explanation of the wholesale
appropviation of others’ thoughts and lauguage, which would
otherwise be sheer plagiarism.'’

The object that Vergil had in writiug the Aeneid is variously Obj1=‹-t ⁰!

stated by writers. Spence, Holrlsworck and Warcon say that
the poem was written with a political object to reconcile the
Romans to the new order cf things. This view is also held
by Pope, who says that the poem had as much a politica]
object as Dryden’s Absalom and Achitophel3 that its primary
obiect was to praise Augustus, and the secondary one was to
flatter the Romans by dwelling on the splendor of their
origin. “Augustus is evidently typificd under the character
of Aeneas, both are cautious and wise in counsel; both are
free from the perturbations of passion ; they were cold, un-
feeling‚ and uninteresting 3 their wisdom auil policy were
worldly-minded and calculating. Augustus was conscious
that he was acting a part, as his last words show ς and the
contrast between the sentiment ancl conduct of Aeneas, when-
ever the warm impulses of affection might be supposed to
have sway‚ likewise created an impression of insincerity.
The characteristic virtue which adorus the hero of the Aeneid
as the epithet pius, so constantly applied to him shows, was
