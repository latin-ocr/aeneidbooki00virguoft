(b) The non-elision of a final vowel or diphthong before an Efflu-
initial vowel, h or diphthong is called a hiacus, e.g.,
Β. Ῑ., 16 z
Posthabxltzi 'colfflisse' ιςᾶΙπιὸ, hic! ἰίἰῖιιε larnai.
B. I. 617 ι
Tam ῑιιε 'immas quem ιυᾶνιιαηηῡ Zamae-04
The lii-st hiatu-3 may be explained that in the case of a
proper noun, and a sense pause, the hiatu-3 is admissible. In

the second example considerable license is admitted in the
case of a proper noun.

(c) Synaeresis is defined as the union of two vowels inspuunt..
sound which should be properly pronounced separat-ely: as
-ei in Oile‘i; -eu in Ilione-u& -ei in ‹Ie-ande. This figure is also
called Synizesis.
e.g. B. Ι. 120: — ..
Jatn υᾶΙῑΙᾶαηι Ilion? ηᾶυΙένη, jam 'fortis Αξσὴᾱιῖἐ,
Β. Ι. 195:
Vina ὂόηΙῡε quiz-e} Ῑιῖἔῖηάὲ clidlis ὄηὲνΙᾶνᾶι Ᾱσὶἔθιὲε.

((1) Synapheia is the principle of continuous scansion. It symm
sometimes happens that a final vowel, diphthong, or -m pre-
ceded byavowel at the end of a line is elided before the
initial vowel, diphthong‚ or h at the beginning of the next
line: '

e.g. B. Ῑ. 332;

Jdcwlmzzr άόεὲῐᾱε {lyrim-i ΙιόηιίΙηᾱπιιῙυε lolem-ammae
Erramus,

So also, B. 1. 448:

Ᾱενὲἅι cai ρνᾰᾱῑιὸῡε rav-§qaam {limium nnaelque
Xer& trabes,

In these lines the final vowel in —qne is struck out before
the initial vowel in the first word of the succeeding line.

There are altogether twenty-one hypermetrical lines in aym.

elevation of the voice (ἆρσις). This naturally falls on the first
syllable of the foot, and we, therefore, find cases oecurriug iu
