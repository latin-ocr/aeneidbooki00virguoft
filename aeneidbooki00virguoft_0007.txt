PREFACE.

 

The present edition is designed to meet the wants of studente reading
for Second Class Certiticates and University Pass Matriculation. The
notes have been purposely made eopious and full. When it is remem-
bered that Vergil is usually put into the hands of a school boy at a
very early period of the course, and that the Aeneid is really a difficule
book for a junior pupil, no apology need be offered for the assistance
given in this edition. The object of the notes is principally to explain
the grammatical difficulties that occur. The latest edition of Harkness’s
Latin Grammar (Standard Edition of 1881) is referred to. In regard to
Orthography‚ though some forms not usually met with in ordinary
editions have been introduced, the readings of Ribbeck have not, as a
whole, been adopted. The pupil would be puzzled if we were to read
e.g. omnis (aec. pl.) in one line, and omne-s· in the next, for the same
case. The letter j throughout has also been retained. Pupils will
never learn to appreciate Vergil, if teaehers bother them with nice
questions of Latin orthography, which, in many cases, are still in
dispute.

The editions of Conington, Kennedy and Greenough have been con·
sulted in preparing the notes of the edition.
