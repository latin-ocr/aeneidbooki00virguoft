(2) Rarely the fifth foot is a spondeo, iu which case the m
line is called a spondaic²⁵ line ε e.g., Β. Ι. 617. ¹¹¹⁸·-

(3) When the last syllable of a word remains over, after Word
the completion of a foot, that syllable is called a caesural caesura„
syllable, in consequence of its being separated, or cuc off, as
it were, from the rest of the word in seaning the verse. Tne
term caesura²3 is also applied to a pause or stress of the
voice, which naturally rests on the caesural syllable. The Vm«
melody of the verse depends in a great measure on the posi· cmm*
tion of the caesura. The chief verse caesuras in the daetylic
hexameter are ε

(a) Penthemimm-al²⁷ Caesura at the end of the first syllable Penthemi·
of the third foot: B. 1. 621. merul

caenum.

It may be observed, generally, that a verse may have one,
two οι· three caesuras ; that verse, however, is best divided
in which the sense pause and the caesural pause coincide ns
in each case given above.
