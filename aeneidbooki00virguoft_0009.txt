LIFE OF VERGIL.

—

Publius Vergilius Μαι-0ι was born on the fflteenth of Birth.
October, BG. 70, in the first consulship of M. Licinius Crassus

and Cn. Pompeius, at Andes, (now Pivtola), a small village
near Mantua. Since the full franchise was not given to this
part of Gaul (Gallia Transpadana) till some years after-
wards²‚ the poet, like many of his predecessors and contem-
poraries in literature, was not a Roman, but an Italian
provincial.⁸

The parents of Vergil, like those of Horace, were of His pamm,
obscure birth. Some authorities say that the poet’s father
was a potter, others, that he was a brickmaker, while others
again assert that he was the servant of a travelling merchant,
Magius, whose daughter, Magia Polla, he afterwards married.
thatever may have been his occupation, certain it is, that
he was at the time of the poet's birth, the steward, factor, or
possessor of an estate near Mantua. The childhood of
Vergil was passed amiel the hills and woods that fringed
the verdant banks of the Mincius, and the carly association of
the poet with the lovely scenery in the neighborhood of his
native town may account for the exquisite touches of pas-
toral life which is so well depieted in the Eclogues and the

Georgics.

⁸ Every Roman citizen had regularly three names-denoting the individua, the
aens or olan, and the familia. Thus in Publius l'eryilius Maro, Publius is the praeno-
men, marking the {mmmmm Ver-mlius is the numen, denoting the ⁸'Jena or elan: while
Maro is the cosmomen. or family name. Sometimes an agnomen was added lor honor-
ary distinction, as Africanus to Scipio, Numidicus ω Metellus. The original torm oi
the name was Vergilius; Virgilius was not common till the middle ages.
