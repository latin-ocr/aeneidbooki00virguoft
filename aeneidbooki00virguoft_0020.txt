beyond the beginnings of nuthentic history, as we find it in
ita most perfect shape in the poems of Homer end Heeiod,
end the responses of the Delphic oracle. Ennius is uid fio

Vergil is generally considered as the model of this kindof
verse among the Latius.

The dactylic hexameter consiste, as its mune implico of ιίι

fifth is usually dactyl, and the sixth invariably e spondes.

(l) For the comparative number of dactyls and spondoe- in
the first four places no definite rule can be given. Gener-ny
speaking, the line is more smooth when the arrangement is
varied to avoid monotnny. A succession of dactyle my be
used for various reasons, eg.. quick motion, cp. B. 1. 90.
